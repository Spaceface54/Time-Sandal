# This README is for the scene flow prototype.

# Scene types:
## Currently only have the prototypes for the studio splash screen, title screen, levels 1 - 3, and the ending scene that allows the player to play again.

# Communication between scenes:
## The variable c is updated across every scene just as a way of keeping track of which scene the player is on. 

# Reachability:
## I believe all scenes should be reachable via tapping and dragging. 

# Transitions:
## Currently only have one fancy transition where the title screen fades out with a light yellow color and the Level 1 screen fades in with the same light yellow color.
