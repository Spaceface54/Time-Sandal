# This README is for the scene flow prototype.

# Scene types:
## Currently only have the prototypes for the studio splash screen, title screen, levels 1 - 3, and the ending scene that allows the player to play again.

# Communication between scenes:
## Currently not applicable.

# Reachability:
## I believe all scenes should be reachable. 

# Transitions:
## Currently no fancy transitions.
