- [main game] https://spaceface54.github.io/Time-Sandal/final_game.html 
    
- [prototypes] https://spaceface54.github.io/Time-Sandal/ 

- [theme] The documentation describes how the theme of "nearby in space, but distant in time" was addressed in the main game's design. (One sentence would be sufficient, but try to keep the description to a single paragraph even if you want to give more detail.)
       - Our game is a puzzle-plaformer where you can go forward and backward in time to solve puzzles. The positon where objects were in one state of time does not change in another, but their qualities and characteristics do, depending on certain factors.

- [selectable requirements] The documentation describes which of the three selectable requirements your team is attempting to satisfy (see below).
    1. Complete closed captioning: Displays sound effect names in the top center
    2. Advanced Visual Assets: Particles, Tilemaps
    3. Alternate control device: Controller support
    
- [contributor credits] The documentation identifies all of the direct contributors to the code and their assigned roles (eg. "testing lead")
    - Testing Lead: Isai Rincon (*flip-flop*)
    - Production Lead: Peter Ampudia  (Flop-Flip)
    - Technology Lead: Nathaniel Chu (It seems your flip has flopped for the last time)

- [asset credits] If the team has built there game using assets created by anyone else (even if those assets were modified before inclusion in the game), the upstream source of those assets should be credited in the documentation as well.
    - All assets were made by us.
    - Visuals made in Adobe Illustrator.
    - Title screen music and background music were made in [petaporon](https://pixwlk.itch.io/petaporon)
    

[source code] The project's textual source code is visible in the team's repository, and specific changes to it are attributable to specific contributors with useful messages summarizing each change.

The game was developed using a tool where most game rules are expressed in hand-typed textual program code (e.g. JavaScript or C#).
   
[mobile] Smooth experience of full-screen play in a mobile browser.
The game is playable using only touch-screen controls. (The player might be allowed to use keyboard/mouse, but the game does not require this of them.)
The game is playable full-screen in a mobile browser. (There is some way for the player to make the game display full-screen and for them to continue playing in that mode.)

    - Fullscreen button in bottom right.

The game is free of distracting technical or design problems that get in the way of completing the entire game in a mobile browser. (For example, the game should not load so slowly that the player thinks the game is broken at first. Any on-screen buttons should be appropriately sized to touch with typically sized human fingers. The animation frame rate should be sufficiently high that motions appear smooth, e.g. >24 fps at almost all times.)

[self-teaching] The player is capable of learning to play from within the game, without consulting outside instructions. (For example, the game's website might say "a touchscreen is recommended for playing this game" but it should not say "tap and drag on the left side of side of the screen to make your character walk". This message should instead be conveyed inside of the game so that the player can learn this without leaving the full-screen mode.)
    - On screen touch screen instructions.
[persistent music toggle] The player is capable of toggling background music from within the game, and this preference is saved across sessions.
The player can turn on and off the game's music independent of any other sound effects used by the game (i.e. we can turn off music but still hear other sounds).
The setting of this configuration value persists across gameplay sessions even if the player closes the browser tab and returns later.
    - music button at the bottom right
[completability] Core gameplay can be reached within 1 minute, and an experienced player of similar games can complete the experience within 10 minutes of their first exposure to the game.
Core gameplay can be reached within 1 minute.
    - yes
The game's main progression can be followed to some satisfying ending point within 10 minutes by a player experienced with related videogames.
    - yes
